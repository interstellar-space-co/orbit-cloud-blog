# Introduction

Darwin, in collaboration with NVIDIA, is reshaping the landscape of computational drug discovery. With its integration of AI and physics-based models, Darwin leverages cutting-edge technology to explore pre-approved drug targets and unknown territories in complex diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. One of Darwin's most transformative capabilities lies in its ability to apply linear scaling laws in compute power to accelerate the discovery process, pushing beyond traditional computational limits.

# Linear Scaling

## Linear Scaling Laws and Sequence Compute: Pushing the Boundaries

One of the core features of Darwin’s approach is its adherence to linear scaling laws, which directly ties sequence length to compute power. As the length of molecular sequences or protein structures increases, Darwin’s GPU-accelerated architecture allows for linear scaling of resources, ensuring that computational demands grow proportionally with data size.

For example, in analyzing the alpha-synuclein protein involved in Parkinson’s disease, Darwin's models can compute sequence-structure predictions 3–4x faster than traditional CPU-based platforms. This scaling law enables Darwin to process complex 50-100k residue protein structures or larger sequences in real-time while optimizing energy minimization and conformational changes through AI-based algorithms. Metrics show that Darwin’s GPU framework achieves up to 10x speed improvements in molecular dynamics simulations, reducing what would normally take months of compute time into days.

By utilizing sequence-to-compute scaling laws, Darwin can handle terabytes of genomic data efficiently, providing drug discovery teams with the computational backbone to explore vast chemical and biological spaces faster than ever before.

# Expanding Unknown Territories Using Pre-Approved Drug Targets

In addition to its AI-driven efficiency, Darwin has a unique approach that leverages pre-approved drug targets to venture into unexplored territories of drug discovery. For example, many FDA-approved drugs target key pathways that are implicated in a variety of diseases. Darwin’s AI platform can take these pre-approved molecules—such as those developed for cardiovascular diseases or metabolic disorders—and reanalyze their interactions with targets involved in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.

For instance, Darwin is investigating how pre-approved inhibitors of amyloid-beta aggregation (a hallmark of Alzheimer’s) can be reconfigured using AI to bind to previously unrecognized conformations of tau proteins. This opens up new therapeutic opportunities without starting from scratch. Darwin’s physics-based models simulate how slight structural modifications of known drugs might optimize their interaction with tau tangles or even alpha-synuclein in Parkinson’s disease, potentially expanding the therapeutic reach of existing molecules.

Moreover, Darwin’s platform allows researchers to explore off-target effects of approved drugs in silico, predicting how these drugs could potentially treat diseases beyond their initial application. This approach not only reduces R&D costs but also significantly cuts down the time to move new treatments into clinical trials by repurposing already-safe compounds.

# Real-World Example: Accelerating Drug Discovery for Parkinson’s

Consider Darwin's analysis of pre-approved dopamine agonists, which are commonly used in treating Parkinson's disease. Through AI-based modeling, Darwin identified that these molecules could be tweaked to affect other neurotransmitter pathways involved in Alzheimer’s disease, particularly cholinergic signaling. This insight emerged from Darwin's ability to model 3D interactions between drug molecules and the target receptors across a vast chemical space in just a fraction of the time using GPU acceleration.

In this context, Darwin’s use of linear scaling laws and repurposing of pre-approved drugs enables it to significantly reduce discovery-to-clinic timelines, opening up new and unexplored therapeutic opportunities for patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases.

# Conclusion

By combining AI and physics-based models, and applying linear scaling laws to sequence computation, Darwin not only accelerates traditional drug discovery processes but also creates new avenues by expanding the therapeutic potential of pre-approved drug targets. For complex diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, this approach offers unprecedented speed, efficiency, and flexibility, making Darwin a true game-changer in computational drug discovery.
