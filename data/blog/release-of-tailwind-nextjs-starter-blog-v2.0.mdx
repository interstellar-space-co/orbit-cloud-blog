## The Role of GPU Acceleration

### How GPUs Accelerate Genomics Workflows

At the heart of this collaboration is **GPU acceleration**, which is critical for speeding up the most computationally intensive steps in genomic workflows, such as **sequence alignment**, **variant calling**, and **assembly**. By using **NVIDIA's powerful GPUs**, Darwin's platform is able to process massive amounts of genomic data faster than traditional **CPU-based systems**.

GPU acceleration improves:
- **Throughput**: Genomics workflows that previously took days to complete on CPUs can now be finished in hours with GPU acceleration.
- **Scalability**: GPU-accelerated workflows can handle much larger datasets, including those from whole-genome sequencing and multi-omics projects.
- **Energy efficiency**: While GPUs offer higher performance, they are also more energy-efficient for certain types of tasks compared to CPUs, reducing overall infrastructure costs.

### Comparison of CPU vs. GPU Performance

Consider the task of aligning DNA sequences against a reference genome, a foundational step in genomics. On a CPU-based system, this task can take hours to days depending on the size of the dataset. However, with **NVIDIA GPUs**, Darwin can accelerate the same process to finish within a fraction of the time. For example, a typical **genome alignment task** on a CPU might take **48 hours**, but with GPUs, it can be reduced to **6 hours** or less, depending on the dataset size.
