# Introduction

Decentralized perpetual contracts have become a cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, enabling users to trade perpetual futures without an expiration date. These contracts are facilitated by **Automated Market Makers (AMMs)**, which algorithmically provide liquidity to traders. However, the design of decentralized perpetual AMMs introduces several risk vectors that must be understood to ensure robust system performance and optimal trader outcomes. This article explores key risks, including **funding rate risks**, **liquidation risks**, and **impermanent loss**, along with quantitative models to describe these risks.

# Funding Rate Mechanism and Its Risks  

The **funding rate** ensures that the perpetual futures price remains anchored to the underlying spot price. Unlike traditional futures, perpetual contracts require a funding payment between long and short positions to correct deviations from the spot price. 

The **funding rate** $f(t)$ is typically calculated as:

$$
f(t) = \frac{P_{\text{perp}}(t) - P_{\text{spot}}(t)}{P_{\text{spot}}(t)} \cdot k
$$

where:  
- $P_{\text{perp}}(t)$ is the price of the perpetual contract at time $t$,  
- $P_{\text{spot}}(t)$ is the spot price of the underlying asset at time $t$,  
- $k$ is a scaling parameter determined by the protocol (often proportional to the time interval between funding payments).  

## Risk: Overcompensated Funding Rate  

When the funding rate is excessively high, long or short positions may receive large payments that create **distortions in open interest**. This overcompensation can lead to:  
- **Market manipulation**: Traders may enter positions purely to collect funding fees, distorting price discovery.  
- **Liquidity imbalances**: Excessive long or short open interest can increase the AMM's risk exposure.  

To quantify the funding impact on system risk, consider the **cumulative funding payment** $F(T)$ over a period $[0, T]$:  

$$
F(T) = \int_0^T f(t) \cdot \text{OI}(t) \, dt
$$

where $\text{OI}(t)$ represents the open interest at time $t$. High volatility in $f(t)$ can increase $F(T)$, which may lead to **protocol insolvency** if traders withdraw more than the AMM can support.

# Liquidation Risks and Collateralization  

Liquidation occurs when a trader’s position falls below the **maintenance margin requirement**. Liquidation risk is influenced by **price volatility** and **collateral efficiency**. The **liquidation threshold** $\theta$ is defined as:

$$
\theta = \frac{\text{Margin}}{\text{Position Size}} \cdot \frac{P_{\text{liquidation}}}{P_{\text{entry}}}
$$  

where:  
- $\text{Margin}$ is the initial collateral,  
- $\text{Position Size}$ is the size of the trader’s leveraged position,  
- $P_{\text{liquidation}}$ is the price at which liquidation occurs, and  
- $P_{\text{entry}}$ is the price at which the position was entered.  

## Risk: Price Slippage and Cascading Liquidations  

In highly volatile markets, large liquidations can trigger **price slippage**, exacerbating losses. This feedback loop can lead to **cascading liquidations** as collateral from liquidated positions is insufficient to cover losses. The slippage $S$ can be modeled as:  

$$
S = \alpha \cdot \Delta Q
$$  

where:  
- $\alpha$ is the AMM’s price impact coefficient,  
- $\Delta Q$ is the change in net position due to liquidations.  

**Mitigation strategies** include setting **progressive liquidation thresholds** or utilizing **off-chain oracles** to assess collateral requirements in real-time.

# Impermanent Loss and AMM Risks  

AMMs continuously rebalance their pools to provide liquidity, leading to **impermanent loss (IL)**—a temporary loss incurred by liquidity providers when the asset prices diverge from their initial values. The impermanent loss for an AMM holding two assets $X$ and $Y$ is given by:  

$$
\text{IL} = 2 \sqrt{\frac{P_{\text{final}}}{P_{\text{initial}}}} - \frac{P_{\text{final}}}{P_{\text{initial}}} - 1
$$  

where:  
- $P_{\text{initial}}$ is the initial price ratio of asset $X$ to $Y$,  
- $P_{\text{final}}$ is the final price ratio of asset $X$ to $Y$.  

## Risk: Extended Divergence in Prices  

For perpetual AMMs, the risk of **extended price divergence** is compounded by open interest and funding payments. The AMM’s **liquidity coverage ratio** (LCR) can be defined as:  

$$
\text{LCR} = \frac{\text{Total Liquidity}}{\text{Open Interest}}
$$  

An LCR below 1 signals that the AMM may not have sufficient liquidity to support further price movement without incurring losses.

# Case Study: Evaluating AMM Risk Under Volatile Conditions  

Consider a decentralized AMM where:  
- The initial liquidity is $10M,  
- The leverage ratio is 10x, and  
- The underlying asset price increases by 30% in one day.  

### Step 1: Funding Rate Calculation  
Assume the funding rate $f(t) = 0.05$ over the 24-hour period:  

$$
F(24) = f(t) \cdot \text{OI}(t) = 0.05 \times 100M = 5M
$$  

This funding payment must be absorbed by either traders or the AMM pool, reducing available liquidity.  

### Step 2: Assessing Impermanent Loss  
With a 30% price increase, the impermanent loss is calculated as:  

$$
\text{IL} = 2 \sqrt{1.3} - 1.3 - 1 = -0.037 \quad (3.7\% \, \text{loss})
$$  

For a $10M liquidity pool, this corresponds to a $370k loss, compounded by the $5M funding payment.  

### Step 3: Liquidation Risk Assessment  
Given the leverage, cascading liquidations are likely if prices continue to diverge, resulting in **slippage** due to insufficient liquidity.

# Mitigation Strategies  

1. **Dynamic Funding Rates:** Implement adaptive funding rates based on volatility.  
2. **Progressive Liquidation Thresholds:** Set liquidation thresholds that increase with market volatility.  
3. **Insurance Funds:** Establish protocol reserves to cover extreme losses.  
4. **Oracle Integration:** Use off-chain oracles for real-time collateral updates.

# Conclusion  

Decentralized perpetual AMMs offer tremendous opportunities for traders but come with significant risks, particularly related to **funding rates**, **liquidations**, and **impermanent loss**. By understanding these risks quantitatively, protocols can implement effective mitigation strategies to ensure long-term stability and profitability.

Orbit continues to develop robust risk models to optimize AMM designs, ensuring DeFi protocols remain resilient even under extreme market conditions.
