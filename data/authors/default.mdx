Darwin is a physics-based cloud platform for computational chemistry, biophysics, and materials science. We provide tools for molecular modeling, simulations, and drug discovery, integrating quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics.

Using Darwin, our users automate and support tasks such as structure-based drug design, virtual screening, and predictive modeling, enabling researchers to accelerate the development of new therapeutics. As of recently, we also offer solutions for materials design and optimization.

Darwin collaborates with scientists based in academia and industry across the world to advance scientific research and innovation.
